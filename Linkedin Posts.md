- Yesterday some of you asked what resources I used for studying for my learning plan. Here is that listðŸ‘‡  
  
  
		ðŸ“˜Operating System Concepts [Silberschatz]  
		  
		ðŸ“˜Database System Concepts [Silberschatz]  
		  
		ðŸ“˜Designing Data-Intensive Applications [Kleppmann]  
		  
		ðŸ“˜Discrete Mathematics [Rosen]  
		  
		ðŸ“˜Introduction to Algorithms [Cormen et. al.]  
		  
		If you are self-taught or bootcamp-taught and get through these you will have a much better grasp on CS fundamentals.
