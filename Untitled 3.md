Yesterday some of you asked what resources I used for studying for my learning plan. Here is that listğŸ‘‡  
  
  
ğŸ“˜Operating System Concepts [Silberschatz]  
  
ğŸ“˜Database System Concepts [Silberschatz]  
  
ğŸ“˜Designing Data-Intensive Applications [Kleppmann]  
  
ğŸ“˜Discrete Mathematics [Rosen]  
  
ğŸ“˜Introduction to Algorithms [Cormen et. al.]  
  
If you are self-taught or bootcamp-taught and get through these you will have a much better grasp on CS fundamentals.
